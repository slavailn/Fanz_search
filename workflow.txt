# Use hhpred we server https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/tools/hhpred to find homologs for Fanzor1 and Fanzor2 
# The sequences for Fanzor 1 and Fanzor 2 were obtained from supplementary materials in Saito et al, 2023 
# https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06356-2#Sec29

# Fanzor 1: Fanzor1:Fungi:Spizellomyces punctatus:ATCC 48900:NW_015971553
# Fanzor 2: Fanzor2:Mollusca:Mercenaria mercenaria isolate YKG-2019:NC_059312

# hhpred search was done using PDB_mmCIF70_24_Dec, Pfam_A_v36, COG_KOG_v1.0 data sets with other search parameters kept at default
# The multiple alignment was created for top hhpred hits with probability over 90% in case of Fanzor 1 and over 95% for Fanzor 2

# Create hmm profiles from Fanzor multiple sequence alignment (MSA) files
hmmbuild --fast --wpb --eent <hmm> <MSA.fasta>

# Seach Fanzor1 and 2 hmm profiles for homologs within a data set of wheat proteins
# The Wheat genome dataset was GCF_018294505.1_IWGSC_CS_RefSeq_v2.1 downloaded from NCBI Genomes
